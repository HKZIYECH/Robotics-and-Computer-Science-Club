      <p class="paragraph2">We as a group decided to establish this club in order to help the youth with the basics of coding and robotics. We are a group of students who are expert developers and designers and willing to share our knowledge with the youth at no cost. Back when we started coding as absolute beginners, we had no mentors who helped us learn the basics of coding, we don't want the same issue to repeat hence we decided to organize this club to help everyone who's interested. <br><br><br> 

        All of us are experts in our fields and we are here to help you learn and grow. Choose your favorite course and get expert guidance from our team of experts who will get you up and running within a few weeks. Coding can't be mastered overnight but with practice and guidance, it can be achieved. Let us introduce ourselves and our area of expertise. <br><br>

It involves designing the user interface and experience, coding the functionality using programming languages like Java or Swift, and testing the app to ensure it works properly on different devices and operating systems. Developers may also integrate features such as GPS, camera access, or push notifications to enhance the app's capabilities. Throughout the development process, collaboration among designers, developers, and testers is essential to create a polished and user-friendly app that meets the needs of its target audience.</p>

      <h2>6. Artificial Intelligence <i class="fa-solid fa-code-branch"></i></h2>
      <p class="paragraph3">Artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes tasks like recognizing patterns, understanding natural language, making decisions, and learning from experience. AI technologies use algorithms and data to mimic cognitive functions, enabling machines to process information, solve problems, and adapt to new situations. AI applications range from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to advanced systems in healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles, with the goal of improving efficiency, accuracy, and automation in various domains.</p>

      <h2>7. Graphic Design <i class="fa-solid fa-paintbrush"></i></h2>
      <p class="paragraph3">Graphic design is the art of visually communicating ideas and messages using images, typography, and layout techniques. Graphic designers use their creativity and technical skills to create designs for various purposes, such as advertisements, logos, websites, and publications. They work with color, shape, and space to create visually appealing and effective designs that convey information and evoke emotions. Graphic design plays a crucial role in branding, marketing, and communication, helping businesses and organizations convey their identity and message to their audience in a visually compelling way.</p>

      <h2>8. Career Path <i class="fa-brands fa-microsoft"></i></h2>
